.NET 6 cryptographic utility

1) Attached and detached digital file signatures (CMS/PKCS#7): signing and verification.
2) Self-signed certificates creation: RSA and ECDSA.
3) AES: file encryption and decryption.
4) Certificate formats conversion: PFX, PEM, CRT, CER.
5) RSA: direct file encryption and decryption (by blocks).
6) ECDH keys generation.
7) GUID creation.
8) File hash computing: MD5, SHAxxx.
9) String conversion tool ("Text Wizard").
10) Cryptographic library (managed and COM-available).
